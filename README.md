# diwali-sales-analysis

In this project, I tried to analyze Diwali sales data and gain insights into customer distribution during the festive season. I performed essential data preprocessing tasks, including removing irrelevant columns and handling null values to ensure data quality. Utilizing data visualization techniques like bar charts and seaborn's countplot, I explored customer demographics based on gender, age, occupation, and state. The analysis provided valuable information for targeted marketing and informed decision-making during the festive season.
